# EBusiness
This repository will have the different projects that I worked on in my E-Business course for the Fall 2020 semester. 

NOTE: For the Online E-Collaboration Website, this was a class effort. Our group was given the Jobs section, and we broke this up in multiple parts. I was responsible for the create/edit/delete/view jobs section.
