Below is the link to the group leader's shared folder where our work so far is stored.
There is still much to be done, but we have some base functionality for the four main protocols - view, create, delete, and edit.
These protocols apply to both jobs and templates, but then we ran out of time.

We can create a new template, but we still need to figure out how to create all the necessary steps and step details; the same could be said for the creation of an instance of a job and its tasks and task details.
Likewise, editing multiple tasks or steps for a job/template also poses a challenge, for we use a form to edit a single task or step.
In the future, someone should be able to edit multiple tasks, but that would mean our form will have to be edited accordingly so the inputs do not share the same name for different tasks to process the form.

There is also a lot of uncertainty about what components we will receive from the other group, and in what form will that data come packaged in.
For example, we hard-coded a session variable for the user's id. We assumed it was a varchar, but it could easily be an integer.

We had very little time to work on the code this week, so we hope to get in up to speed upon Professor Pham's feedback.
